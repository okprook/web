Opt for healthier bedtime snacks such as Greek yogurt with berries or a small handful of nuts to satisfy your cravings without derailing your weight loss goals. Emotional Eating: Many of us turn to food for comfort when we’re feeling stressed, anxious, or upset. While indulging in our favorite treats may provide temporary relief, it can also lead to a cycle of emotional eating and weight gain. Instead of reaching for food to cope with emotions, find alternative ways to manage stress such as meditation, exercise, or talking to a trusted friend or therapist.
